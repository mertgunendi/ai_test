# Mert Can Günendi's Deep Learning Image Classification Project

Welcome to the Deep Learning Image Classification project by Mert Can Günendi. This project is designed to classify images into various categories using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or enthusiast, you can utilize this system for image recognition tasks.

## Features

- Multi-class image classification.
- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for high accuracy.
- Seamless integration with your labeled image dataset.
- Training and inference scripts for easy usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Your labeled image dataset

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Organize your image dataset in the following structure:

   ```
   ├── dataset/
       ├── category_1/
           ├── image1.jpg
           ├── image2.jpg
           └── ...
       ├── category_2/
           ├── image1.jpg
           ├── image2.jpg
           └── ...
       └── ...
   ```

## Usage

1. **Training the Model:**

   Train the image classification model using your dataset:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Classifying an Image:**

   You can use the trained model to classify a specific image:

   ```bash
   python classify.py path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```
